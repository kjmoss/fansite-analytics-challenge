Please be advised, I spent a significant amount of time on the programs themselves, but due to time constraints, I didn't spend much time testing them on the log.txt within the test-suite. I was unable to determine why they failed the run-tests. This was possibly due to different interpretations or my considering data sets smaller than the number of rankings. I hope you consider my programs despite the difficulties I faced in running them with the test suite. This fellowship program would be of significant value to me, and I hope to receive consideration despite the difficulties.
